__Do you think it is possible to earn 1-million on Fiverr?__

We read the article  [How a dad made almost 1 million on Fiverr](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/how-this-dad-made-almost-1-million-on-fiverr.html?__source=msn%7Cmoney%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&par=msn&doc=105300315) and were just as curious about the question as you are. 

First, we collected more articles about what people earn on Fiverr, then tried to prove how realistic a story like this is.

We collected real data for each of the sellers and calculated what they earned so far with their Gigs.


We found out this:


|Seller          | Estimated Revenue|
|:---------------|-----------------:|
|Charmaine Pocek |           1734610|
|Joel Young      |           1039405|
|Levi Newman     |            557599|
|Redd Horrocks   |            474512|
|Alex Fasulo     |            167215|
|David Feldman   |             61889|



We also found out that just one single Gig made one seller over 500k, which is unbelievable.
