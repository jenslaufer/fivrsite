__Do you think it is possible to earn 1-million on Fiverr?__

I was inspired by the article [How a dad made almost 1 million on Fiverr](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/how-this-dad-made-almost-1-million-on-fiverr.html?__source=msn%7Cmoney%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&par=msn&doc=105300315) and was just as curious about this question as you are. 

I collected more articles about what people earn on Fiverr, then I tried to prove how realistic a story like this is.


| Seller | Type of service | Income |
| ------ | --------------- | -----: |
| [Joel Young](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/how-this-dad-made-almost-1-million-on-fiverr.html?__source=msn%7Cmoney%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&par=msn&doc=105300315)| Voice Over | $1,000,0000|
| [Charmaine Pocek](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/05/31/how-these-3-people-make-6-figures-a-year-on-fiverr/)| Resume writing | $480,000|
| [Levi Newman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/05/31/how-these-3-people-make-6-figures-a-year-on-fiverr/)|Copywriting| $180,000 |
| [Redd Horrocks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/05/31/how-these-3-people-make-6-figures-a-year-on-fiverr/)|Voice Over| $180,000 |
| [Alex Fasulo](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/bills-to-pay/how-this-25-year-old-freelancer-made-dollar150000-in-6-months-off-fiverr/ar-AAzkNOA)| Press Release Writing | $150,000 |
| [David Feldman](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/18/how-this-38-year-old-is-making-6-figures-freelancing-on-fiverr.html)|Copywriting|$100,000|



I collected real data for each of the sellers and calculated what they earned so far with their Gigs.


I found out this:


|Seller          | Estimated Revenue|
|:---------------|-----------------:|
|Charmaine Pocek |           1734610|
|Joel Young      |           1039405|
|Levi Newman     |            557599|
|Redd Horrocks   |            474512|
|Alex Fasulo     |            167215|
|David Feldman   |             61889|

Charmaine Pocek and Joel Young are in the 1-million-on-fiverr-circle. 
Charmaine is made almost 2,000,000. This is impressing.


I also found out that just one single Gig made one seller over 500k, which is unbelievable.
